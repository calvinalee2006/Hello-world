# hello-world
This is my hello world repository

My name is Calvin but I prefer to go by Cj. I have been a mechanic for over a decade and something it feels like it has been 5 decades of nothing but wrench turning, complaints (customer and co-worker) and heavy lifting. I think I am ready for a change and i believe that web development IS my change.
